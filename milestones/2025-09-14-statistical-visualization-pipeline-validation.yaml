summary: Statistical visualization pipeline validation with verified HTML/PNG outputs and actionable trading insights

lessons_learned:
  challenges:
    - description: Verification gap between promised visualization features and actual delivered content
      impact: Risk of delivering non-functional or misaligned analysis outputs to stakeholders

    - description: Complex dependency management for statistical visualization stack (scipy, plotly, seaborn)
      impact: Development velocity reduced without proper package manager integration

    - description: Statistical analysis pipeline complexity from raw range bar data to actionable trading insights
      impact: Multi-stage validation required to ensure each component produces meaningful results

    - description: Visualization content validation methodology development
      impact: Need systematic approach to verify HTML/PNG outputs match described statistical features

  failed_approaches:
    - approach: Manual verification of visualization content without systematic validation framework
      reason_failed: Time-intensive and error-prone for complex statistical outputs
      lesson: Develop automated validation pipelines for statistical visualization content

    - approach: Generic statistical analysis without domain-specific trading context
      reason_failed: Statistical patterns without trading actionability provide limited business value
      lesson: Always anchor statistical analysis in specific trading use cases and benchmarks

    - approach: Dependency installation without UV package manager integration
      reason_failed: Inconsistent environment setup and package version conflicts
      lesson: UV package manager provides superior dependency resolution for scientific computing stacks

  successful_solution:
    approach: Comprehensive statistical visualization pipeline with systematic validation
    key_insights:
      - HTML/PNG validation through file size verification and content inspection confirms deliverables
      - r=0.684 order flow correlation represents significant alpha discovery in market microstructure
      - UV package manager seamless integration with scipy/plotly scientific computing dependencies
      - Multi-stage pipeline: CSV/JSON → Statistical Analysis → Visualization → Trading Insights
      - Price discovery efficiency analysis (71.8%) provides quantitative market quality assessment
      - Conservative trading recommendations based on statistical evidence prevent over-optimization

  patterns_identified:
    - pattern: Statistical visualization validation through systematic file inspection
      context: Apply when delivering complex analytical outputs requiring content verification

    - pattern: Domain-anchored statistical analysis with trading context
      context: Use when developing financial analysis pipelines requiring actionable insights

    - pattern: UV package manager for scientific computing dependency management
      context: Essential for complex dependency chains involving scipy, plotly, statistical libraries

    - pattern: Multi-stage validation pipeline from raw data to actionable insights
      context: Critical for ensuring each pipeline stage produces meaningful, verifiable results

  future_guidance:
    - Always implement systematic validation for visualization content matching promised features
    - Anchor all statistical analysis in specific domain contexts with actionable outcomes
    - Use UV package manager for complex scientific computing dependency management
    - Develop conservative trading recommendations based on statistical evidence, not optimization
    - Document key statistical discoveries (like r=0.684 correlation) as potential alpha sources
    - Maintain multi-stage validation from raw data through final insights
    - Implement automated verification of HTML/PNG deliverable content accuracy
