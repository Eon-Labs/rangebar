# HARD-LEARNED LESSONS
lessons_learned:
  critical_discovery_methodology: >
    The multi-agent audit approach successfully validated the critical
    is_buyer_maker field preservation fix, demonstrating the importance
    of comprehensive multi-perspective validation beyond unit testing.

  performance_architecture_insight: >
    Incremental microstructure calculations during bar construction
    rather than post-processing provides both performance benefits
    and mathematical accuracy through conservation law maintenance.

  audit_validation_importance: >
    Manual JSON output auditing combined with automated testing caught
    calculation accuracy issues that pure unit testing might miss,
    validating the comprehensive validation methodology.

  ecosystem_alignment_value: >
    Binary naming alignment with Rust ecosystem patterns (rangebar-export)
    significantly improves developer experience and reduces cognitive load
    compared to generic naming (rangebar).
