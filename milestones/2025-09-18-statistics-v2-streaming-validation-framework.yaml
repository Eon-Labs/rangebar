summary: Statistics-v2 streaming validation framework with production-ready numerical algorithms

lessons_learned:
  challenges:
    - description: Validating streaming statistical algorithms against known baseline statistics
      impact: Without comprehensive validation tests, production deployment would risk incorrect statistical computations affecting downstream analysis

    - description: Integration of T-digest percentile estimation with 2% accuracy requirements
      impact: Percentile calculations critical for risk management and performance analysis - accuracy errors compound in downstream models

    - description: Welford's algorithm implementation for numerically stable variance computation
      impact: Naive variance calculation suffers from catastrophic cancellation with high-precision financial data - stability essential

    - description: Test binary artifact management in repository structure
      impact: Compiled test binaries polluted git tracking, requiring .gitignore patterns to maintain clean repository state

    - description: Version bump coordination for crates.io publishing compatibility
      impact: Statistics module changes require semantic versioning coordination to maintain backward compatibility guarantees

  failed_approaches:
    - approach: Simple statistical validation using hardcoded expected values
      reason_failed: Financial data exhibits statistical properties that require tolerance ranges, not exact matches
      lesson: Statistical validation must account for algorithmic precision limits and floating-point representation

    - approach: Single comprehensive validation test covering all statistical features
      reason_failed: Large monolithic tests are difficult to debug when specific statistical computations fail
      lesson: Modular validation tests with specific focus areas enable precise failure isolation and debugging

    - approach: Manual test execution without automated validation framework
      reason_failed: Manual testing doesn't scale and introduces human error in statistical verification
      lesson: Automated sensibility checks with clear pass/fail criteria essential for production statistical modules

  successful_solution:
    approach: Comprehensive validation framework with known-good test data and automated sensibility checks
    key_insights:
      - Realistic trade data with known statistical properties enables predictable validation outcomes
      - Automated sensibility checks catch algorithmic errors through bounds checking and ordering verification
      - Modular test structure with trade processing and bar processing validation enables targeted debugging
      - T-digest percentile accuracy within 2% tolerance for P50-P99 calculations meets production requirements
      - Rolling statistics maintain O(1) memory footprint through Welford's algorithm implementation
      - Test binary exclusion patterns prevent repository pollution while preserving test execution capability

  patterns_identified:
    - pattern: Statistical validation requires tolerance-based comparison, not exact equality
      context: Financial statistical algorithms where floating-point precision and algorithmic approximation introduce bounded error

    - pattern: Known-good test data with documented statistical properties enables predictable validation
      context: Testing statistical algorithms where input data properties must be controlled and verifiable

    - pattern: Automated sensibility checks catch regression errors through bounds and ordering validation
      context: Statistical modules where manual verification is error-prone and doesn't scale to production

    - pattern: Test artifact exclusion patterns maintain clean repository state during development
      context: Rust projects with test binaries that generate executable artifacts requiring git management

  future_guidance:
    - Design statistical validation tests with tolerance ranges based on algorithmic precision characteristics
    - Create modular validation tests focusing on specific statistical computations for precise failure isolation
    - Implement automated sensibility checks with clear pass/fail criteria for production statistical modules
    - Document test data statistical properties to enable predictable validation outcomes and debugging
    - Use .gitignore patterns for test binary artifacts to maintain clean repository state
    - Coordinate version bumps with statistical module changes to maintain semantic versioning integrity
