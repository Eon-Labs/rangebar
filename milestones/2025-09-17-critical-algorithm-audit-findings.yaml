summary: Critical algorithm audit reveals 47% breach consistency violations in streaming mode, data inconsistency between processing modes, and memory optimization requirements

lessons_learned:
  production_streaming_processor_fixes:
    - resolution: "Fixed algorithmic integrity in Production Streaming V2"
      details: "Corrected processor reset logic to maintain proper range bar state"
      impact: "V2 now produces algorithmically consistent results with batch processing"
      validation: "1M trades → 14,336 bars (realistic 1.4% completion rate vs previous 1:1 ratio)"
      bounded_memory_confirmed: "Maintains <1MB memory usage regardless of input size"

  critical_findings:
    - finding: Streaming mode produces 47% breach consistency violations
      impact: Invalid range bars generated in streaming architecture violating core algorithm specification
      scope: rangebar-streaming-test implementation producing non-compliant range bars
      severity: critical_blocking_production_use

    - finding: Adversarial processing generates 599 extra bars vs Concurrent processing
      impact: Non-deterministic results from identical input data indicating algorithm inconsistency
      scope: Different processing pipeline implementations producing different outputs
      severity: high_data_integrity_violation

    - finding: Large-scale processing hits OOM at dual thresholds - 197M trades (sequential) and 533M trades (concurrent)
      impact: Cannot process very large datasets reliably, exit code 137 (Linux OOM killer)
      scope: Sequential processing (multi-year, adversarial) fails at 197M trades, concurrent processing at 533M trades
